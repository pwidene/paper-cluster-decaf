Scientific simulation workflows have traditionally used
the storage array as a staging place between the components
that make up the workflows
and employed a high-level task manager to trigger these components.
Recent work has been investigating moving these
workflows to purely online models, thus avoiding the 
well-known performance bottleneck of storage arrays.
While existing workflow management systems
can successfully organize and schedule such online workflows, the components
are generally either written from
scratch, or they at least require significant
changes for them to fit
into different workflows
in which the components
operate on different
data formats.

In this work, we present Superglue,
a set of generic workflow components
that can be used to assemble a variety of static, online
workflows without the need for re-compilation.
We leverage the self-describing and multidimensional properties
of data exchanged by the Adaptable
I/O System to assemble and run three workflows
based on three different and widely-used simulation codes
exporting different types of data.
In this way, we present the building blocks of a library
of generic workflow components, which we hope can
eventually facilitate the assembly of
workflows meeting a variety of analytical needs
in the scientific computing community.

Considering the well-known bottleneck that is the persistent storage array,


Scientific simulation workflows have traditionally focused on using the storage
array as a staging place between components and employ a high level task
manaager to trigger components. Recent work has been investigating moving these
workflows to purely online models avoiding the storage array bottlenecks. This
transition is not cost free, but there are also potentially enormous advantages.
For example, by moving online, more the data movement is limited by bisection
bandwidth rather than storage bandwidth. However, making existing tools work
online may take some modification and adding in the ``glue'' components required
to translate the output from one component to the input for the next are no
longer simple scripts.

This paper examines these tradeoffs and lays out when the advantages may make
moving purely online worthwhile even though not being forced by platform
limitations. Support tools necessary to support both models are also discussed
including offering standardized ``glue'' components for online workflows making
the transition easier.
