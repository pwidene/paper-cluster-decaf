abstract={It is often difficult to perform efficiently a collection of jobs with complex job dependencies due to temporal unpredictability of the grid. One way to mitigate the unpredictability is to schedule job execution in a manner that constantly maximizes the number of jobs that can be sent to workers. A recently developed scheduling theory provides a basis to meet that optimization goal. Intuitively, when the number of such jobs is always large, high parallelism can be maintained, even if the number of workers changes over time in an unpredictable manner. In this paper we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a practical scheduling tool inspired by the theory. Given a DAGMan input file with interdependent jobs, the tool prioritizes the jobs. The resulting schedule significantly outperforms currently used schedules under a wide range of system parameters, as shown by simulation studies. For example, a scientific data analysis application, AIRSN, was executed at least 13\% faster with 95\% confidence. An implementation of the tool was integrated with the Condor high-throughput computing system},

        Abstract = {
A key to reducing the risks and costs associated with oil and gas exploration is the fast, accurate imaging of complex geologies, such as salt domes in the Gulf of Mexico and overthrust regions in U.S. onshore regions. Prestack depth migration generally yields the most accurate images, and one approach to this is to solve the scalar-wave equation using finite differences.
Current industry computational capabilities are insufficient for the application of finite-difference, 3-D, prestack, depth-migration algorithms. A 3-D seismic data can be several terabytes in size, and the multiple runs necessary to refine the velocity model may take many years. The oil companies and seismic contractors need to perform complete velocity field refinements in weeks and single iterations overnight. High-performance computers and state-of-the-art algorithms and software are required to meet this need.
As part of an ongoing ACTI project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, we have developed a finite-difference, 3-D prestack, depth-migration code for the Intel Paragon. The goal of this work is to demonstrate that massively parallel computers (thousands of processors) can be used efficiently for seismic imaging, and that sufficient computing power exists (or soon will exist) to make finite-difference, prestack, depth migration practical for oil and gas exploration.},

End Computing (HEC) platforms can generate large volumes
of data. For high performance storage and in order to be
useful to science end users, such data must be organized in
its layout, indexed, sorted, and otherwise manipulated for subsequent
data presentation, visualization, and detailed analysis.
In addition, scientists desire to gain insights into selected data
characteristics `hidden' or `latent' in these massive datasets
while data is being produced by simulations. PreDatA, short for
Preparatory Data Analytics, is an approach to preparing and
characterizing data while it is being produced by the large scale
simulations running on peta-scale machines. By dedicating
additional compute nodes on the machine as `staging' nodes
and by staging simulations' output data through these nodes,
PreDatA can exploit their computational power to perform
select data manipulations with lower latency than attainable
by first moving data into file systems and storage. Such intransit
manipulations are supported by the PreDatA middleware
through asynchronous data movement to reduce write
latency, application-specific operations on streaming data that
are able to discover latent data characteristics, and appropriate
data reorganization and metadata annotation to speed up
subsequent data access. PreDatA enhances the scalability and
exibility of the current I/O stack on HEC platforms and
is useful for data pre-processing, runtime data analysis and
inspection, as well as for data exchange between concurrently
running simulations.},

As we move to petascale computation, we are seeing a trend not only in the growth but also in the consolidation of computing resources. As the distances between user and petascale visualization resources grow, the expected performance of the network degrades, especially with respect to latency. In this paper we will explore a technique for remote visualization that leverages unstructured lumigraph rendering. This technique will provide an interactive rendering experience regardless of the network performance to the remote visualization resource. The unstructured lumigraph rendering can also replace many of the other level-of-detail techniques currently used that have problems that are exasperated by petascale data.}

Especially within e-science infrastructures driven by high-performance computing (HPC) such as DEISA, online visualization and computational steering (COVS) has become an important technique to save compute time on shared resources by dynamically steering the parameters of a parallel simulation. This paper argues that future supercomputers in the Petaflop/s performance range with up to 1 million CPUs will create an even stronger demand for seamless computational steering technologies.

  abstract={Remote procedure call (RPC) is a technique that has been largely adopted by distributed services. This technique, now more and more used in the context of high-performance computing (HPC), allows the execution of routines to be delegated to remote nodes, which can be set aside and dedicated to specific tasks. However, existing RPC frameworks assume a socket-based network interface (usually on top of TCP/IP), which is not appropriate for HPC systems, because this API does not typically map well to the native network transport used on those systems, resulting in lower network performance. In addition, existing RPC frameworks often do not support handling large data arguments, such as those found in read or write calls. We present in this paper an asynchronous RPC interface, called Mercury, specifically designed for use in HPC systems. The interface allows asynchronous transfer of parameters and execution requests and provides direct support of large data arguments. Mercury is generic in order to allow any function call to be shipped. Additionally, the network implementation is abstracted, allowing easy porting to future systems and efficient use of existing native transport mechanisms.},

As an example, iPaq clients can display 2D derived data functions which can be used to dynamically update and annotate the shared data space, which might be visualized separately on a large immersive display such as a CAVE.

abstract = {Emerging high-performance distributed computing environ-
ments are enabling new end-to-end formulations in science
and engineering that involve multiple interacting processes
and data-intensive application workflows. For example, cur-
rent fusion simulation efforts are exploring coupled models
and codes that simultaneously simulate separate application
processes, such as the core and the edge turbulence, and run
on different high performance computing resources. These
components need to interact, at runtime, with each other
and with services for data monitoring, data analysis and vi-
sualization, and data archiving. As a result, they require effi-
cient support for dynamic and flexible couplings and interac-
tions, which remains a challenge. This paper presents Data-
Spaces, a flexible interaction and coordination substrate that
addresses this challenge. DataSpaces essentially implements
a semantically specialized virtual shared space abstraction
that can be associatively accessed by all components and
services in the application workflow. It enables live data
to be extracted from running simulation components, in-
dexes this data online, and then allows it to be monitored,
queried and accessed by other components and services via
the space using semantically meaningful operators. The un-
derlying data transport is asynchronous, low-overhead and
largely memory-to-memory. The design, implementation,
and experimental evaluation of DataSpaces using a coupled

abstract={As scientific simulation applications evolve on the path towards exascale, a new model of scientific inquiry is required where concurrently with the running simulation, online analytics operate on the data it produces. By avoiding offline data storage except when absoluately necessary, it enables speeding up the scientific discovery process by providing rapid insights into the simulated science phenomena and affording more frequent, detailed data analytics than is possible with the traditional purely offline approach of using disk for intermediate data storage. However, a challenge for online analytics is to respond to behavior dynamics caused by changing simulation outputs and by unforeseen events on the underlying hardware/software platforms. This paper presents SODA, a set of run-time abstractions for online orchestration of data analytics, realized by embedding analytics tasks into workstations that monitor component behavior and enable responses to run-time changes in their resource demands and in the platform's resource availability. For high end simulations running on a leadership class machine, experimental evaluations show SODA can invoke efficient orchestration operations responding to a diverse set of run-time dynamics at different granularities to meet end-user and analysis specific requirements.},

abstract={Current exascale computing projections suggest rather than a monolithic simulation running for the majority of the machine, a collection of components comprising the scientific discovery process will be employed in an online workflow. This move to an online workflow scenario requires knowledge that inter-step operations are completed and correct before the next phase begins. Further, dynamic load balancing or fault tolerance techniques may dynamically deploy or redeploy resources for optimal use of computing resources. These newly configured resources should only be used if they are successfully deployed. Our D2T system offers a mechanism to support these kinds of operations by providing database-like transactions with distributed servers and clients. Ultimately, with adequate hardware support, full ACID compliance is possible for the transactions. To prove the viability of this approach, we show that the D2T protocol has less than 1.2 seconds of overhead using 4096 clients and 32 servers with good scaling characteristics using this initial prototype implementation.},

    title = {Transactional Parallel Metadata Services for Application Workdflows},
    abstract = {Scientific simulations have a different relationship with all of the data generated than many data analysis systems that support applications like the Large Hadron Collider and the SLOAN Sky Survey. In many cases, simulations need to generate large number of intermediate data sets that ultimately are thrown away once some analysis routines are applied to the data. This generates some summarized, derived result that inspires some scientific insight. Traditionally, these routines use the storage array to persist the intermediate results between each step of the data analysis process. The volume and frequency of this data can be overwhelming compared with the available IO bandwidth on the machine. To handle this volume and frequency, current research efforts are determining how to move the storage of intermediate data from the storage array into the memory of the compute area. Then, the analysis routines are incorporated to create Integrated Application Workflows (IAWs). Data staging techniques require some mechanism to replace the semantics offered by the file system to control data movement and access. As part of an HPC-focused transaction services project, a first pass at a transactional metadata service for in compute area data storage is being developed.},
