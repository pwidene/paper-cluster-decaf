\section{Problem Formulation}
\label{s:problem}
Below are some questions that we address in this work. The goal in answering these questions is to provide 
guidelines that facilitate the assembly and configuration of \sys-based workflows.
\begin{outline}
  \1 What are the weak scaling properties of the various components?
  \1 Can we expect similar weak scaling properties from the same component in different workflows?
  \1 What are the strong scaling properties of the various components?
    \2 Can similar properties be expected from the same components in different workflows? Different machines? Different times?
    \2 Is there an ideal range of process sizes for a given global data size? If so, what are these ranges for the various components?
  \1 How much do the above properties vary according to the nature of the data?
  \1 Limits
    \2 Can we enforce limits on the execution time of individual time steps for the \sys components?
    \2 Can we enforce limits on the memory usage of the components?
  \1 Inter-component effects
    \2 How is the performance of one fixed-size component affected by varying the process size of another component in the workflow?
\end{outline}
