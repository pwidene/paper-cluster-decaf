\begin{outline}
  \1 Compatible interfaces
  \1 Multi-dimensional data support
    \2 Design components that can operate on multi-dimensional data as much as possible
  \1 Semantics
    \2 Use well-defined dimensions and keep track of the dimensions' meaning throughout the workflow
  \1 Need for data re-arrangement primitives (eg \dimreduce)
\end{outline}
