\section{Background}
\label{s:background}
In previous work, we presented a set of \sys components, as well as some guidelines to follow in their design:
\begin{outline}
  \1 Compatible interfaces
  \1 Multi-dimensional data support
    \2 Design components that can operate on multi-dimensional data as much as possible
  \1 Semantics
    \2 Use well-defined dimensions and keep track of the dimensions' meaning throughout the workflow
  \1 Need for data re-arrangement primitives (eg \dimreduce)
\end{outline}
