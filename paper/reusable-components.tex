This section provides greater details about the individual SuperGlue components
and how a small number of
parameters allow the them to operate (a) on a variety
of different input data formats, and (b) in
a user-specified way.

\subsection{Select}

Given an input stream that includes an array with any number of dimensions,
Select extracts certain indices from one of the dimensions. Thus, it outputs an array
with the same number of dimensions, but with the dimension of interest having a
smaller size. In order to select the quantities of interest, the
component uses a header which must be passed by the previous component in the
workflow. The header is a list of strings that name the quantities in the
dimension of interest. This allows for easy selection of quantities at runtime when
Select is launched. For example, in the LAMMPS workflow, the simulation outputs
the ID, Type, Vx, Vy, and Vz of each particle, where Vx, Vy, and Vz are the
components of the three-dimensional particle velocity.
Select discards the ID and Type, building a new array consisting only of the velocity components.
The user, or a higher-level dataflow assembler, must pass to
this component the index of the dimension from which to select, as well as the
indices of the quantities of interest within that dimension.

\subsection{Dim-Reduce}

Dim-Reduce is a glue component that removes one dimension from its
input array, ``absorbing'' it into another dimension without modifying the
total size of the data. The other dimensions are left unchanged. This component
can work with an input array having any number of dimensions. The output is an
array with one dimension removed and with another dimension that has been
re-defined. When using this component, the user must specify which
dimension to eliminate and which to grow.

\subsection{Magnitude}

In our current implementation, Magnitude expects a two-dimensional array as
input, where one dimension spans the data points at each time step (particles
in the case of LAMMPS and grid points in the case of GTC) and the other
dimension spans any number of components of the same vector, for example the
three-dimensional components of velocity in the LAMMPS workflow. Magnitude
calculates the magnitudes of the vectors from the values of their
individual components and outputs
a one-dimensional array of the new values. Which dimension is which in the input
array is specified by the user at runtime. A small number of changes and a few
start-up parameters could generalize this code to perform any number of
common operations that calculate a quantity from many,
applying a known formula over a two-dimensional dataset, thus
allowing this component to fit into a variety of scientific workflows.

\subsection{Histogram}

The processes that make up the Histogram component partition among themselves
a one-dimensional array of data. They communicate to discover the global
minimum and maximum values in the array, create a number of bins between these
two extremes, and then communicate again to count the number of values in the
globally partitioned array that fall in each bin. The number of bins to use
must be passed to the component when it is launched.

In our current implementation, one of the processes of Histogram writes the
output to a file on disk. We chose this approach because this component is
generally used as an endpoint in the workflow and because the output of this
component is generally very small compared to its input and can be easily
written by a single process.
However, as we see now, letting this component output its data in the
same way as the other components, that is as an ADIOS stream, and instead writing to
disk when needed using a component specifically designed for this purpose would
provide greater flexibility.

\subsection{Dumper}

While this component was not created in time for this paper, the value of
a component specifically designed to be the endpoint of a workflow
is clear. The key goal for this component is to offer a way to write an ADIOS stream into an
output file using some particular format. Whether to write the workflow output as
HDF5, ADIOS-BP, or a simple text file could simply be selected by the user as an option,
requiring no modifications to existing components, and no re-compilation.

Another component that would be of value would be one with a graph plotting capability.
For example, GNU
Plot~\cite{racine:2006:gnuplot} takes a simple text input description and
generates a graph.  Rather than having the graphing component write to
disk, it should also push out an ADIOS stream to some other consumer. An
additional Dumper that writes an image file in a particular format, such as
JPEG, PNG, or SVG, would be a valuable addition.
