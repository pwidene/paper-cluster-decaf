\section{Configuration Guidelines}
\label{s:guidelines}
\noindent
By adressing the above questions, we hope to determine:
\begin{outline}
  \1 A ``safe'' range of numbers of processes for each \sys components in a workflow 
  to use given a known simulation output size
  \1 A range of numbers of processes to use to ensure desired limits on timestep completion time and memory usage
  \1 An understanding of the weak scaling properties of \sys
\end{outline}
