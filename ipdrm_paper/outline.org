#+TITLE: ipdrm paper outline
* main points to emphasize this time
SuperGlue name added confusion: change.
reduce in general, especially intro/background
focus on the key aspects
much confusion re: role of the components
in the IPDPS submission: start with a description 
of components immediately, and their role in forming a workflow
* intro
Keep much of the same but reduce.
Skip fusion example.
Stay on point.
Remove ref's to "glue code".
The (a) (b) (c) of difficulties in existing tools
should be the focus: it's the problem statement.
